# SQL_Sales-and-Forecast-Accuracy
In this project, I utilized SQL to analyze and report on sales data for FY 2021. The key objectives were to generate insights on gross sales, identify top-performing markets, and measure forecast accuracy.
Key Components:
1.Gross Sales Report: Aggregated sales data to identify growth and decline trends across different regions and markets.
2.Market Performance Evaluation: Implemented a "Market Badge" system to categorize markets based on their sales performance, helping prioritize resource allocation and strategic focus.
3.Top Markets by Region: Identified the top-performing markets in each region, providing a granular view of regional performance and guiding future business strategies.
4.Forecast Accuracy Analysis: Created a helper table to compare actual sales against forecasted sales, calculating accuracy percentages and highlighting areas for improvement in forecasting.
Outcomes:
The project provided valuable insights into market dynamics, helping optimize demand planning and inventory management. It also highlighted key areas for improving forecasting methods to align projections more closely with actual sales performance.
